## Description
This is a site that is meant to make uploading and organizing one's artwork easy and detailed. Eventually the goal would be add a feature that makes users work sharable with friends so that users could comment or interact with other's art work.

## Basic Needs

* Uses PHP/Laravel
* Uses a database with at least 2 tables. This count does not include a users table, but does include pivot tables
* Demonstrates all 4 CRUD interactions (user signup/login does not count towards this)
* Demonstrates server-side error validation

## Demo

## Materials
* My artwork
* debug bar
* Lots (and lots) of TA help- thank you!
